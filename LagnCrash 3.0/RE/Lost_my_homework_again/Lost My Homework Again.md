Attachements:<br/>
(don't worry there aren't any actual viruses... i think?)<br/>

[virus1.s](assets/virus1.s)<br/>
[virus2.s](assets/virus2.s)<br/>
[README.md](assets/README.md)<br/>
[txt.txt](assets/txt.txt)<br/>

## Starting out
Opening the README.md, we are told:
```
The virus has encrypted the master key using 2 programs:

virus1.s and virus2.s

For every character X,
X was passed into virus1.s which produces the first line of output in txt.txt
X was passed into virus2.s which produces the second line of output in txt.txt

Carl was too lazy to make the programs accept standard input, so line 6's MOV instruction is the "input".
Every number was "inputted" to the program by assigning it to the X0 register on line 6. Just change the #122 to some other number.

Carl was also too lazy to output anything, so the program actually outputs using its return status code.
Not that you should be running this program anyway.

Both outputs are required to reconstruct the original value. Good luck!
```
This tells us two things:<br/>

1. Both lines of the txt file were encrypted from the same plaintext
2. The 'virus' programs will encrypt the plaintext letter by letter

Now, let's take a look at the viruses:<br/>

Since we know that the 'virus' programs will encrypt the same plaintext letter by letter, let's see what the 'virus' does.

## Reading assembly code

Both 'viruses' are written in ARM64 assembly. <br/>
For those unfamiliar, here is a quick guide: [ARM64 cheatsheet](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/19wi/arm64.pdf) <br/>
For the extra lazy, here's the python equivalent for relevant sections

The virus encrypts the text and outputs it to the [txt.txt](assets/txt.txt) file. <br/>

The [txt.txt](assets/txt.txt) files give the following:<br/>
Virus1 encryption:
`48 39 27 36 45 69 36 78 45 30 78 81 66 69 48 75 63 69 42 78 51 27 42 81 66 81 48 72 54 69 75 27 51 81 42 81 51 30 45 81 51 27 45 81 45 39 75 30`
<br/>

Virus2 encryption:
`0 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 1 1 0 2 1 2 3 0 2 2 2 3 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 1 3 0 2 1 3 1 1 0 1`
<br/><br/>
This gives us slight confidence that the python conversion was correct since all numbers from virus1 are divisible by 3. <br/>

To solve the challenge, we clearly need to reverse the program to get the original plaintext.

## Actual reversing/Exflitration
Reversing the program is rather simple. <br/>
Both viruses perform a similar function initially; Taking 20 off the initial number<br/>
After which, virus2 will return its remainder when divided by 4, <br/>
While virus1 sums the quotient and remainder and multiply it by 3. </br>
</br>

Recall that each value of the inital plaintext was passed through each function.

From this, we can deduce the steps to reversing it:
1. Divide virus1's output by 3
2. Obtain the quotient by subtracting virus2's output (the remainder)
3. multiply it by 4 and add the remainder
4. add 20 to get the original value<br/>

For the sake of the writeup, here's the mathematical proof: <br/>

$$ v1 = 3\bigg[\Big\lfloor{\frac{n-20}{4}}\Big\rfloor + \bmod\Big(\frac{n-20}{4}\Big)\bigg] $$

$$ v2 = \bigg\lfloor{\frac{n-20}{4}}\bigg\rfloor $$

$$ \frac{v1}{3} = \Big\lfloor{\frac{n-20}{4}}\Big\rfloor + \bmod\Big(\frac{n-20}{4}\Big) $$

$$ \therefore \frac{v1}{3} - v2 = \bmod\Big(\frac{n-20}{4}\Big) $$

$$ \therefore n - 20 = 4 \Big(\frac{v1}{3} - v2\Big) + \bigg\lfloor{\frac{n-20}{4}}\bigg\rfloor =  4\Big(\frac{v1}{3} - v2\Big) +v2 $$

$$ \Rightarrow n = 4\Big(\frac{v1}{3} - v2\Big) +v2 + 20 $$

<br/>

Here is a [sample solve script](assets/solve.py) written in python:
```py
v1_out = "48 39 27 36 45 69 36 78 45 30 78 81 66 69 48 75 63 69 42 78 51 27 42 81 66 81 48 72 54 69 75 27 51 81 42 81 51 30 45 81 51 27 45 81 45 39 75 30".split(" ")
v2_out = "0 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 1 1 0 2 1 2 3 0 2 2 2 3 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 1 3 0 2 1 3 1 1 0 1".split(" ")

v1_out = [int(i) for i in v1_out]
v2_out = [int(i) for i in v2_out]

def re(v1_out, v2_out):
    x = []

    for i in range(len(v1_out)):
        remainder = v2_out[i]
        quotient = v1_out[i] / 3 - remainder
        num = quotient * 4 + remainder + 20
        x.append(int(num))

    return x

key = re(v1_out, v2_out)
plaintext = "".join([chr(i) for i in key])
print(plaintext)
```

The output of virus1 gives us `TE5DMjAyM3swcmQxbmFsX2FzczNtYmx5XzFzX3MwX2MwMEx9`

Wait a second.. that's not the flag?!

## Stare harder

Just as I do with challenges when I do not know where to start, I threw the output into cyberchef. <br/>
The magic button told me it was encoded in base64. <br/>
